Simulation and Machine learning projects for P9102
*Data mining* (sometimes called data or knowledge discovery) is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information, with an emphasis on large observational data bases.
Machine learning concerns with design of algorithms that allow machines (computers) to learn from data or learn from examples.

The term “machine learning” comes from the artificial intelligence community, but is now a focus area in many branches of statistics, computer science and applied math
